Been coding nonstop this weekend. I've been making big progress on the site, and that's been fun. But damn do my eyes hurt. Been staring at this screen for hours on end. I need to take a break.

You know, it sucks how the world is shifting towards a more digital, device-oriented society. We've always got technology in our faces. Always looking at stuff close-up. Ever since childhood. Staring at a screen consistently as a child sets you up for myopia in the future, since you're probably not spending time outside in the sun and getting that vital dose of sunlight that's necessary to signal your brain to release dopamine into your eyeballs for proper eye development in early life. At least that's what I've gotten from the research I've read. It fucks our vision up, and that's unfortunate. Well, as much as technology is responsible for our worsening vision, at least we have technology to thank for corrective lenses and laser eye surgery too. Not long ago, if your vision was bad, that was that. 

Ok. That's it. Time to take a break.
