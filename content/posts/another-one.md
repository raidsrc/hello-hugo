Still building my website. It's taking forever. 

At the University of California Davis, classes have been moved online until the end of January. I went back home to Piedmont and have decided to chill there for the time being. On one hand, I'll have my basic needs met. Don't need to worry about freezing my ass off when I wake up. Or starving to death. Plus I've got access to my upright piano and drum kit once more. Which is great. But on the other hand, I hate taking classes online. I fucking hate Zoom University. Remote learning is absolute garbage. Can't focus, can't motivate myself, can't see the purpose of it, can't do well. And I've got a little bit less freedom back home. Up at Davis I can do almost whatever I want, whenever I want. Just isn't the same at home.
