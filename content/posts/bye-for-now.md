Back at school. I made it into the UC Davis Jazz Ensembles despite completely missing auditions. But the band director has heard me play before, so at the very least he knows I'm not absolute garbage. Anyway, this means I've got to go to in-person rehearsals. We've got a concert coming up at the end of the quarter. And I'm rusty as hell at jazz drumming. Plus I got a cut on my left thumb from a super sharp scalpel and the bandage makes it hard to do rolls. I sliced my thumb open trying to open a jar of peanut butter. Don't ask. Not my proudest moment.

Still working on the site(s). It's still fun. But I'm running out of time. Life is speeding up and I'm struggling to keep pace. 

Got results from a COVID-19 test yesterday. Negative. I think I'm just built different. I've been exposed multiple times to multiple people who tested positive. I'm still negative. ~~Fuck a virus fr on god on 2 virgils keepin it a buck fifty imma wipe a viruses nose if it comes down to it~~

Alright. I'm done here. Peace out. I'll get back to writing here someday, maybe, I don't know.
